# Definitions

**1. Class**
    - Class is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data member and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. 

**2. Object**
    - Variable/Instance of a Class. 

Ex: 
        **int**-(datatype) **x**-(variable);
        **Class**-(datatype) **Object**-(variable);

**3. Inheritance**
    - Inheritance is a feature or a process in which, new classes are created from the existing classes. The new class created is called “derived class” or “child class” and the existing class is known as the “base class” or “parent class”.

**4. Abstraction**
    - Technique of hiding few things/funtionalities of a class.
    - Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details

    a. Data Abstraction - shows the required information about the data and hides the unnecessary data
    
    b. Control Abstraction - shows the required information about the implementation and hides unnecessary information

      i. Abstraction using Classes. 
     ii. Abstraction using Header files. 
    iii. Abstraction using Access Specifiers. Public, Private, and Protected. 

**5. Polymorphism**  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-polymorphism/
    - One/Same name multiple functionalities.

    i. Compile Time / Static Polymorphism
        a. Function Overloading
        b. Operator Overloading
    ii. Run Time / Dynamic Polymorphism
        a. Virtual Functions

**6. Encapsulation**
    - Binding of data members and member functions together.
